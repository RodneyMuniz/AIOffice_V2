# AIOffice Operator UI

React + TypeScript + Vite console for the R19 product reset operator workflow.

## Setup

```bash
cd apps/operator-ui
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Backend URL

The UI expects the orchestrator API at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

To override it:

```powershell
set VITE_AIO_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
npm run dev
```

On Unix-like shells:

```bash
VITE_AIO_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run dev
```

## Operator Flow

- Create a card from the UI.
- Create a work order linked to an existing card.
- Optionally request an approval gate while creating a work order.
- Create a separate approval request.
- Approve or reject pending approvals.
- See cards, work orders, approvals, events, and evidence refresh after each action.

## Local State

Records are served by `services/orchestrator-api` and persisted as JSON under `runtime/state/`. To reset the local demo state, stop the backend, delete generated `runtime/state/*.json` persistence files, then restart the backend.

## Current Limitations

- No authentication or routing yet.
- No long-lived client state management beyond API refreshes.
- No background workers or autonomous agent execution.
- No OpenAI or Codex API invocation is implemented.
- This proves a local operator UI/API workflow slice, not full product runtime.
