# AIOffice

AIOffice is being rebuilt as an admin-only, self-build-first product for governed software production.

The current repo is a clean reset. Its first acceptable proof boundary is supervised workflow through `architect` plus bounded `apply/promotion` control. That narrow proof boundary is now formally claimable from direct repo evidence, and the closeout is recorded in `governance/R2_FIRST_BOUNDED_V1_PROOF_CLOSEOUT.md`. Git and persisted state remain the intended truth substrates.

## Start Here
- `governance/VISION.md`
- `governance/PROJECT.md`
- `governance/V1_PRD.md`
- `governance/OPERATING_MODEL.md`
- `governance/DECISION_LOG.md`
- `governance/ACTIVE_STATE.md`
- `governance/R2_FIRST_BOUNDED_V1_PROOF_CLOSEOUT.md`
- `governance/R3_GOVERNED_WORK_OBJECTS_AND_DOUBLE_AUDIT_FOUNDATIONS.md`
- `execution/KANBAN.md`
- `execution/PROJECT_BRAIN.md`

## Current V1 Boundary
Current V1 is intentionally narrow:
- admin-only
- self-build first
- supervised
- docs-first or API-first is acceptable
- no broad UI requirement

## Bounded Proof Command
Replay the currently claimed bounded suite locally with:
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\run_bounded_proof_suite.ps1`

This replays the focused R2, R3, and R4 bounded tests through one fail-closed entrypoint. It does not broaden the proved boundary into UI, Standard runtime, rollback, automatic resume, or broader orchestration claims.

## Not Required In Current V1
- broad UI or control-room proof
- Standard or subproject pipeline work
- later-lane live workflow proof beyond `architect`
- legacy task or milestone migration

## Repo Layout
- `governance/`
  Constitutional and operating truth.
- `execution/`
  Fresh reset backlog and working primer.
