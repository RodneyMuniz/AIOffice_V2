# AIOffice Decision Log

This log starts fresh with the clean reset repo. It does not import donor milestone-ratification history.

## D-0001 Reset Bundle Authority
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The reset bundle is the bootstrap authority for the clean repo.
- Consequence: Donor repo history is reference material only unless selectively reused through reset guidance.

## D-0002 Admin-Only Self-Build V1
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Current V1 is admin-only and self-build first.
- Consequence: Broad rollout and team-scale UX are not gates for current proof.

## D-0003 First Proof Boundary
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The first acceptable proof boundary is supervised operation through `architect` plus bounded `apply/promotion` control.
- Consequence: Later-lane workflow proof is deferred.

## D-0004 Truth Substrates
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Git and persisted state remain the truth substrates for the product.
- Consequence: Narrated status alone is non-authoritative.

## D-0005 No Legacy Planning Migration
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Legacy tasks, milestones, kanban states, and milestone history are not migrated into the new repo.
- Consequence: The backlog and active state start fresh.

## D-0006 Narrow Current Surface
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Broad UI or control-room work is deferred, and no Standard or subproject pipeline is required in current V1.
- Consequence: The repo may use docs-first or API-first operating surfaces for the first proof.

## D-0007 Clean Rebuild Bias
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: A cleaner rebuild is preferred over preserving noisy continuity.
- Consequence: Preserve doctrine and control patterns, not legacy baggage.

## D-0008 First Real Implementation Milestone
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The first real implementation milestone is `R2 Minimum Control Substrate`.
- Consequence: The current work is limited to four ordered tasks only: stage artifact contracts through `architect`, persisted state substrate, bounded `apply/promotion` gate, and a minimal admin-only supervised harness.
- Consequence: This milestone prepares the minimum real control substrate needed for the first bounded proof while keeping live workflow proof stopped at `architect`.
- Consequence: Broad UI, Standard or subproject pipeline work, later-lane workflow, and donor backlog import remain out of scope for the current slice.

## D-0009 RST-009 Accepted After External Audit
- Date: 2026-04-19
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `RST-009` is accepted after external audit at commit `b9b3edca10992cc497349d6d35b61da90583f66e`.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that durable stage artifact contracts exist for `intake`, `pm`, `context_audit`, and `architect`, that a validator path exists, and that malformed artifacts are rejected.
- Consequence: acceptance is based on the committed implementation plus reported run results; the external auditor did not independently replay PowerShell execution in-thread.
- Consequence: the next gated step is `RST-010` Implement persisted state substrate for packet and truth reconciliation.
