# AIOffice Decision Log

This log starts fresh with the clean reset repo. It does not import donor milestone-ratification history.

## D-0001 Reset Bundle Authority
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The reset bundle is the bootstrap authority for the clean repo.
- Consequence: Donor repo history is reference material only unless selectively reused through reset guidance.

## D-0002 Admin-Only Self-Build V1
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Current V1 is admin-only and self-build first.
- Consequence: Broad rollout and team-scale UX are not gates for current proof.

## D-0003 First Proof Boundary
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The first acceptable proof boundary is supervised operation through `architect` plus bounded `apply/promotion` control.
- Consequence: Later-lane workflow proof is deferred.

## D-0004 Truth Substrates
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Git and persisted state remain the truth substrates for the product.
- Consequence: Narrated status alone is non-authoritative.

## D-0005 No Legacy Planning Migration
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Legacy tasks, milestones, kanban states, and milestone history are not migrated into the new repo.
- Consequence: The backlog and active state start fresh.

## D-0006 Narrow Current Surface
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Broad UI or control-room work is deferred, and no Standard or subproject pipeline is required in current V1.
- Consequence: The repo may use docs-first or API-first operating surfaces for the first proof.

## D-0007 Clean Rebuild Bias
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: A cleaner rebuild is preferred over preserving noisy continuity.
- Consequence: Preserve doctrine and control patterns, not legacy baggage.

## D-0008 First Real Implementation Milestone
- Date: 2026-04-18
- Status: accepted
- Decision: The first real implementation milestone is `R2 Minimum Control Substrate`.
- Consequence: The current work is limited to four ordered tasks only: stage artifact contracts through `architect`, persisted state substrate, bounded `apply/promotion` gate, and a minimal admin-only supervised harness.
- Consequence: This milestone prepares the minimum real control substrate needed for the first bounded proof while keeping live workflow proof stopped at `architect`.
- Consequence: Broad UI, Standard or subproject pipeline work, later-lane workflow, and donor backlog import remain out of scope for the current slice.

## D-0009 RST-009 Accepted After External Audit
- Date: 2026-04-19
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `RST-009` is accepted after external audit at commit `b9b3edca10992cc497349d6d35b61da90583f66e`.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that durable stage artifact contracts exist for `intake`, `pm`, `context_audit`, and `architect`, that a validator path exists, and that malformed artifacts are rejected.
- Consequence: acceptance is based on the committed implementation plus reported run results; the external auditor did not independently replay PowerShell execution in-thread.
- Consequence: the next gated step is `RST-010` Implement persisted state substrate for packet and truth reconciliation.

## D-0010 RST-010 Accepted After External Audit
- Date: 2026-04-19
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `RST-010` is accepted after external audit at commit `d78fcaec9eda7c99ffade6be846e7f715fa3f235`.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that durable packet-record contracts exist, that packet records persist and reload, and that packet identity, stage progression, approvals, artifact refs, Git refs, and reconciliation state are durably represented.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that working state, accepted state, and reconciliation state are kept distinct.
- Consequence: non-blocking caution recorded for future hardening: validator integrity is still permissive in one area and the current implementation does not yet enforce stricter chronology between `accepted_state` and `current_stage` / `stage_progression`.
- Consequence: this caution did not block acceptance because `RST-010` done criteria were still met.
- Consequence: the next gated step is `RST-011` Implement bounded `apply/promotion` gate with fail-closed checks.

## D-0011 RST-011 Accepted After External Audit
- Date: 2026-04-19
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `RST-011` is accepted after external audit at commit `f7afa5c42367386fae04e7d2511941de4ff58f7f`.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that durable gate contracts exist, that explicit approval, bounded scope, approved artifact linkage, and reconciliation checks exist, and that blocked outcomes are durably recorded back into packet state.
- Consequence: acceptance is based on the committed implementation plus reported run results; the external auditor did not independently replay PowerShell execution in-thread.
- Consequence: the next gated step is `RST-012` Implement minimal admin-only supervised harness for substrate walk.

## D-0012 RST-012 Accepted After External Audit
- Date: 2026-04-19
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `RST-012` is accepted after external audit at commit `4e954ff05f83cf592ccb423bd50973c78cf6f771`.
- Consequence: the accepted step proves that a minimal admin-only supervised harness exists, that it can create or load a packet, that it validates stage artifacts through `architect`, that it reuses the accepted packet-record substrate and bounded `apply/promotion` gate, and that it durably records allow or block results without broad UI.
- Consequence: acceptance is based on the committed implementation plus reported run results; the external auditor did not independently replay PowerShell execution in-thread.
- Consequence: the next gated step is `R2 first bounded V1 proof review`.

## D-0013 R4-002 Closed Packet Chronology And Lifecycle Caution
- Date: 2026-04-20
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `R4-002` closes the non-blocking chronology and integrity caution carried forward from `RST-010`.
- Consequence: packet-record validation now fails closed when `stage_progression` regresses, when `accepted_state.accepted_stage` is ahead of `current_stage`, when accepted-state chronology precedes the accepted-stage progression entry, or when accepted packet state exists without approved approval state.
- Consequence: the closure is backed by focused packet-record validation and transition tests in `tests/test_packet_record_storage.ps1`.
- Consequence: the next gated step inside R4 is `R4-003` Add explicit pipeline and scope foundation hardening.

## D-0014 R4-003 Added Explicit Pipeline And Scope Foundation Hardening
- Date: 2026-04-20
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `R4-003` adds explicit admin-only pipeline metadata, protected-scope declarations, and fail-closed scope validation across the bounded planning-record and governed work-artifact surfaces.
- Consequence: planning records, Request Briefs, Task Packets, Execution Bundles, QA Reports, External Audit Packs, and Batons now carry explicit bounded pipeline and scope declarations instead of relying on narration or implied posture alone.
- Consequence: invalid Standard-runtime claims and contradictory scope declarations now fail closed under focused tests, while repo truth continues to preserve the no-Standard-runtime boundary for current V1 and R4.
- Consequence: the closure is backed by the focused planning-record, work-artifact, and Request Brief to Task Packet tests in `tests/test_planning_record_storage.ps1`, `tests/test_work_artifact_contracts.ps1`, and `tests/test_request_brief_task_packet_flow.ps1`.
- Consequence: the next gated step inside R4 is `R4-004` Harden the bounded workflow loop already proved.

## D-0015 R4-004 Hardened The Bounded QA Follow-Up Loop
- Date: 2026-04-20
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `R4-004` hardens the bounded planning-to-QA-to-baton chain by requiring accepted planning handoff into QA, carrying explicit retry metadata on the bounded Execution Bundle, QA Report, Remediation Record, and Baton surfaces, and fail-closing invalid QA follow-up handoff states.
- Consequence: the bounded QA loop now stops explicitly at the retry ceiling with durable `retry_exhausted` and `manual_review` handoff state instead of permitting indefinite remediation softness.
- Consequence: retry-entry Execution Bundles must derive from the immediately prior failed or blocked QA Report plus a follow-up Baton, and manual-review stop state cannot be silently re-entered as another bounded retry.
- Consequence: the closure is backed by the focused contract, QA gate, baton persistence, and replay tests in `tests/test_work_artifact_contracts.ps1`, `tests/test_execution_bundle_qa_gate.ps1`, `tests/test_baton_persistence.ps1`, and `tests/test_r3_planning_replay.ps1`.
- Consequence: the next gated step inside R4 is `R4-005` Add a deterministic repo-local proof runner.
