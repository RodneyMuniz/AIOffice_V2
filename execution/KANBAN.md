# AIOffice Kanban

This board tracks the current reset milestone structure only.

## Active Milestone
No active implementation milestone is open after R8 closeout.

Current posture:
`R8` is now closed in repo truth as a bounded QA and proof trust milestone. `R8-001` through `R8-009` are complete, with the R8 closeout proof package at `state/proof_reviews/r8_remote_gated_qa_subagent_and_clean_checkout_proof_runner/`, the QA proof packet at `state/proof_reviews/r8_remote_gated_qa_subagent_and_clean_checkout_proof_runner/artifacts/clean_checkout_qa/qa_proof_packet.json`, and starting remote-head verification at `state/proof_reviews/r8_remote_gated_qa_subagent_and_clean_checkout_proof_runner/artifacts/remote_head_verification/remote_head_verification_starting_head.json`. External proof runner foundation exists at `.github/workflows/r8-clean-checkout-qa.yml`, but no concrete CI or external proof artifact is claimed because no real workflow run identity was triggered and verified. No committed exact-final post-push verification artifact is claimed because it would be self-referential to the final pushed commit. R8 does not open R9 and does not prove UI, Standard runtime, multi-repo orchestration, swarms, broad autonomous milestone execution, unattended automatic resume, destructive rollback, production-grade CI for every workflow, or general Codex reliability.

## Most Recently Closed Milestone
`R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`

Closeout summary:
`R8-001` through `R8-009` are complete and formally closed in repo truth. The closeout authority is `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`, the committed proof-review basis is `state/proof_reviews/r8_remote_gated_qa_subagent_and_clean_checkout_proof_runner/`, the starting remote head is `e27464278c2fb29cc3269b562019784124451288`, and decision authority is `D-0053`. This closeout remains bounded to one remote-gated QA/proof trust substrate for one repository and one active milestone cycle only.

Prior closed milestone:
`R7 Fault-Managed Continuity and Rollback Drill` remains honestly closed under `governance/R7_FAULT_MANAGED_CONTINUITY_AND_ROLLBACK_DRILL.md`, the committed proof-review basis under `state/proof_reviews/r7_fault_managed_continuity_and_rollback_drill/`, and decision authority `D-0050`.

## Tasks

### `R8-001` Open R8 and freeze the remote-gated QA boundary
- Status: done
- Order: 1
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `governance/R7_FAULT_MANAGED_CONTINUITY_AND_ROLLBACK_DRILL.md`, `state/proof_reviews/r7_fault_managed_continuity_and_rollback_drill/`, `D-0050`
- Authority: `README.md`, `governance/ACTIVE_STATE.md`, `governance/DECISION_LOG.md`, `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: updated repo-truth surfaces that open R8 as planning only and freeze the exact remote-gated QA boundary
- Done when: R8 is open in repo truth, R7 remains honestly closed, no post-R8 milestone is opened, and scope or non-scope or stop conditions are explicit

### `R8-002` Define QA proof packet contract
- Status: done
- Order: 2
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-001`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one durable machine-validated QA proof packet contract plus future validation surfaces
- Done when: the packet requires remote head, tree hash, command list, raw logs, exit codes, environment, dirty or clean status, artifact hashes, QA verdict, and refusal reasons

### `R8-003` Implement remote-head verification gate
- Status: done
- Order: 3
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-002`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one gate that records branch, local head, remote head, commit subject, tree, timestamp, and pass or fail for remote branch truth
- Done when: local-only completion claims fail closed on local or remote mismatch

### `R8-004` Implement post-push verification gate
- Status: done
- Order: 4
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-003`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one final remote-head verification artifact path that proves the exact landed SHA after push
- Done when: completion cannot be claimed without post-push verification for the exact final remote SHA

### `R8-005` Implement clean-checkout QA runner
- Status: done
- Order: 5
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-004`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one clean or disposable checkout QA runner pinned to the exact remote SHA, with raw log output root
- Done when: the runner checks out the exact remote head, runs declared commands, captures stdout or stderr or exit codes, and records clean or dirty status before and after

### `R8-006` Harden proof-package validator for complete command logs
- Status: done
- Order: 6
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-005`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one proof-validator hardening layer that rejects claimed commands without raw or support log coverage
- Done when: generator, validator, proof-review test, Git hygiene, remote-head, and QA runner commands all fail closed if coverage is missing

### `R8-007` Add CI or equivalent external proof runner
- Status: done
- Order: 7
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-006`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one external proof execution path with concrete artifact identity
- Done when: CI or equivalent external execution can run the clean-checkout QA flow and publish or reference artifacts with concrete run identity

### `R8-008` Add status-doc gating
- Status: done
- Order: 8
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-007`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`
- Durable output: one status-doc gating layer across `README.md`, `governance/ACTIVE_STATE.md`, `execution/KANBAN.md`, and `governance/DECISION_LOG.md`
- Done when: status docs cannot claim milestone `done` or `closed` without QA packet, remote-head verification, and proof refs, and stale "most recently closed" contradictions fail validation

### `R8-009` Pilot and close R8 narrowly
- Status: done
- Order: 9
- Milestone: `R8 Remote-Gated QA Subagent and Clean-Checkout Proof Runner`
- Depends on: `R8-008`
- Authority: `governance/R8_REMOTE_GATED_QA_SUBAGENT_AND_CLEAN_CHECKOUT_PROOF_RUNNER.md`, `governance/DECISION_LOG.md`
- Durable output: one bounded R8 closeout path that uses the remote-gated QA process on itself
- Done when: R8 closes only after remote-gated clean-checkout QA passes, explicit non-claims remain intact, and no broader automation claim is made

## Explicitly Out Of Scope For This Milestone
- UI or control-room productization
- Standard runtime
- multi-repo orchestration
- swarms
- broad autonomous milestone execution
- unattended automatic resume
- destructive rollback on the primary working tree
- production-grade general CI for every future workflow
- productized control-room behavior
- general "Codex is now reliable" claims
